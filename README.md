# Advancing-recidivism-prediction-for-male-juvenile-offenders-A-machine-learning-approach
This study applies machine learning to forecast recidivism among male juvenile offenders using the SAVRY dataset from Hunan Province, China. Algorithms including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and SVM achieved over 95% accuracy on test data. Ensemble methods, hyperparameter optimization, and Explainable AI enhanced model predictability, fairness, and interpretability, significantly improving performance in predicting juvenile recidivism.
