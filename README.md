# Advancing-recidivism-prediction-for-male-juvenile-offenders-A-machine-learning-approach applied to prisoners in Hunan Province
This study uses machine learning approach to forecast thelikelihood of recidivism among male juvenile offenders. The dataset utilized in this study is the Structured Assessment of Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY) dataset, which was obtained from Hunan Province, China. After conducting a meticulous examination, a variety of machine learning algorithms were evaluated, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).These models demonstrated a remarkable accuracy rate above 95% when implemented on the test dataset. The implementation of ensemble approaches, hyperparameter optimizers, and feature selection methods resulted in an enhanced level of predictability. Furthermore, Explainable AI was used to assess the fairness and validity of the models. Our results demonstrate that this proposed approach has successfully improved the performance and interpretability of the ML models to predict juvenile recidivism among young offenders.
